Here is the material for Reservoir Computing for next week - one paper
(with accompanying slides), plus a second paper if we have time.

===
Overview:

Next week's paper is Reservoir Computing by Felix Grezes. But if you are
new to randomized projections, you may want to start with the blog post
from by Terence Tao and/or the Nuite Blanche blog post to learn about
the underlying concepts - links to both blogs are below, after Grezes'
paper and slides.

If we have time we may also discuss "Information Processing Using a
Single Dynamical Node as Complex System."

This is a short, very useful backgrounder on randomized projections,
here used for compressed sensing, in a blog post by Terence Tao
https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/04/13/compressed-sensing-and-single-pixel-cameras/

and the same story told with illustrations on the Nuit Blanche blog:
http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2007/07/how-does-rice-one-pixel-camera-work.html

(BTW http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com is a tremendous website.)

If we have time, we may discuss this paper:
